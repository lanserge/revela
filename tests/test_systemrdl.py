"""The SystemRDL rendering must be the same map as the JSON and the decode.

The allocation now has three renderings: the decode in the emitted Verilog, the
JSON register map, and the SystemRDL. ``test_regfile.py`` binds the first two
together; this file binds the third, by ELABORATING the emitted ``.rdl`` with
the reference SystemRDL compiler and comparing every resulting address against
the JSON map. Text comparison would only prove the file looks right; elaboration
proves a consumer's tooling agrees about what it means.
