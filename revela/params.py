"""Parameter declarations and register-map allocation.

RULE 2 lives here. A parameter is declared ONCE, by the block that owns it, in
LOCAL terms only -- a block never knows its absolute address. A single ``Param``
declaration drives four things:

  1. the arithmetic in the block's NumPy model (via :meth:`Param.to_np2hw`),
  2. the CSR width and offset in the generated Verilog,
  3. the register-map documentation,
  4. the host-side accessor.

Absolute addresses are assigned at composition time, per block INSTANCE, by
:mod:`revela.compose`. That is what makes a stereo pipeline (every block
instantiated twice) and standalone unit tests both work: the block declaration
is instance-free.

Three kinds of state, deliberately kept distinct
------------------------------------------------

``Param``      BLOCK-OWNED CONFIG. CCM coefficients, gamma tables, WB gains.
               Lives in the owning block's register map. Written to a shadow
               register; the shadow is committed to the live value at the FRAME
               BOUNDARY, so a frame is never processed with half-updated
               coefficients. A write during frame N takes effect on frame N+1.

``Context``    PIPELINE CONTEXT. Width, height, active window, Bayer phase, bit
               depth. Declared by the ``pipe`` block, which is an ordinary block
               at base 0, and fanned out to consumers as WIRES. Never duplicated
               as a per-block CSR -- there is exactly one width register in a
               pipeline, not one per block.

``StatsWindow`` STATISTICS. A memory-mapped RAM window in a separate address
               region, read in bulk rather than as scattered CSR words, and
               double-buffered per frame: the host reads frame N while frame N+1
               accumulates. NOT commit-on-vsync -- that is a config mechanism and
               means the opposite thing.

Fixed-point convention
----------------------

``bits`` is the register width; ``frac`` is how many of those bits are
fractional. A gain declared ``Param("gain", bits=16, frac=8)`` is Q8.8, so the
integer 256 means 1.0. The model does the arithmetic in integers and shifts by
``frac``; ``frac`` exists so the documentation and the host API can present a
human number without anyone re-deriving the scale factor. Nothing in
``revela/blocks/`` ever converts a parameter to float.
