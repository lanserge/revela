"""The video stream interface, and its AXI4-Stream Video adapter.

Every block in revela consumes one stream and produces one stream. The interface
is deliberately small: pixel data, two framing flags, and a ready/valid
handshake at every block boundary.

    clk, rst
    valid   -> source has a pixel this cycle
    ready   <- sink can accept one this cycle
    data    -> `channels` components of `bit_depth` bits, channel 0 in the low bits
    sof     -> this pixel is the first of a frame
    eol     -> this pixel is the last of its line
    last    -> this pixel is the last of the frame (sof of the next frame follows)

A transfer happens on a cycle where ``valid && ready``. ``sof``, ``eol`` and
``last`` are qualified by ``valid`` and ride alongside the pixel they describe --
they are not separate pulses to be counted against a pixel stream.

Why these flags and not a coordinate bus
----------------------------------------

Framing that travels with the data is self-describing: a block never needs to
know the frame size to know where it is, so one bitstream serves any resolution
and the pipeline context registers (width, height) are needed only where the
geometry genuinely matters -- line buffers and windowing. This is what lets the
same generated core process any line length up to its buffer size.

``last`` is redundant with ``eol`` plus a line count, and ``sof`` is redundant
with the previous ``last``. Both are carried anyway because recovering them costs
every consumer a counter, and because they are what AXI4-Stream Video's TUSER and
TLAST mean -- carrying them makes the adapter a rename rather than logic.

Relationship to np2hw
---------------------

The cores np2hw generates already present exactly this interface
(``in_valid/in_ready/in_sof/in_data`` -> ``out_valid/out_ready/out_sof/out_eol/
out_last/out_data``). This module names it, parametrises it on bit depth and
channel count, and gives the testbenches a way to turn NumPy arrays into beats
and back. It does not re-implement it.
